This directory contains [examples](main.js) of this library.

To execute them, first [install](../README.md#install) `fast-cartesian`. Then
run `node node_modules/fast-cartesian/examples/main.js`.

You can edit the examples.

They can also be run directly
[in your browser](https://repl.it/@ehmicky/fast-cartesian).
